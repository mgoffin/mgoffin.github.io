This is either vitreous humour (eye), semen (genitals) or blood (heart). This knife then acts as a focus for the magick. The mage hurls the dagger at his enemy and it is drawn towards the correct area. Of course it helps if the mage's aim is  reasonable but the magick greatly increases his chance of success. There are many very old daggers in use by the Euthanatos, passed down from mentor to disciple. These are often African throwing knives and use of one of these ritual items can make the magick far more potent. Over the centuries these blades have been stained distinct colours. Yellow blades are drawn to the eye, white blades fly for the genitals and the most common black daggers pierce the heart. \"Life magick identifies the target area, Forces guides the blade towards it. Each success reduces the difficulty of hitting the target area by one. The base difficulties are normally eyes +3, groin +2 and heart +2. Use of a knife with the appropriate resonance will reduce the difficulty of the magickal success roll.\""

The visual effect\nis that you appear in many places at once (your most probablility dense zones)\nand you are actually at all of them (without Corr 4!). You can also exhibit\nquantum tunnelling effects. You can go through walls if they are not suffucient\nbarriers to stop your wavefunction. The disadvantages are that being a quantum\nparticle the uncertainty principle effects you alot. When the effect is\ndropped, you can end up being anywhere your wavefunction existed. You are also\ndisorientated by this experience. But can anyone hide something in an area\nbetter than thin rote. Total randomness and limited invulnerability to the\nwavefunctions from standard means of attack.

The mage can \nuse the Rote to cloud an entire \"event\", so that it is difficult to use \nTime to observe what happened (or will happen). The Rote will extend \nslightly forward and backward in time to hide the entire event. The mage \nneed not maintain the effect, for any attempt to sense it must by \nnecessity observe the time when the Rote was in affect. Some Euthanatos \nuse this Rote to complicate Temporal investigations of their murders.\nThis Rote is also commonly used to block Correspondence Sensing as well.  \nSince Correspondence sensing is difficult magick, a little static can go \na long way. However, the Rote must be maintained for the entire time the \nmage wishes to be protected.\n[The number of successes sets up a \"threshold\" which a sensing mage must \novercome to magickally examine the target. These successes are \nsubtracted from the successes of any sensory magick of the appropriate \ntype. If the successes of the cloud exceed the successes of sensing, the \nsensing mage believes that their magick simply failed, and is unaware of \nthe cloud. If the successes of both are equal, the mage is aware that \nhis senses are being blocked, but they cannot penetrate the cloud.

For\nexample, the semi-random behaviour of an ecosystem can be kept within\ncertain bounds by adding a Coordinator Structure, or the fluctuations of\nthe Market could in principle be controlled using self-sustaining\nCoordinator Structures (the Syndicate has vetoed this).

Since the effect cancels out all other light waves, it \ncannot be penetrated by viewing on infrared or ultraviolet.

The \nEuthanatos carefully cuts apart a fresh corpse and select the parts that \nhe needs - this always includes the face. He then places these over his \nown body parts where they merge with his own flesh, bonding into one \nentity. This rote makes him into a perfect simulacrum of the victim - \nface, fingerprints, hair, as close as he desires. One variation on this \nrote even enables him to speak like the deceased by consuming the \ntongue. This melding also affects his life pattern, sometimes enabling \nhim to pass magickal detection. All of the attached parts are infused \nwith his own blood and actually become part of him. Therefore they do \nnot appear dead but the removal of the disguise is very messy. It is \neven more bizarre if the mage was larger than the victim because he \nappears to split out of the smaller body (and like a snake, leaving the \n\"skin\" behind). Quite frankly, it\"s rotes like this that get the \nEuthanatos a bad name. \n\"Life and Matter magick enable the blending of mage and corpse. Minor \ncuts and abrasions that the corpse sustained may be repaired but tissue \ndamage e.g. burns will increase the difficulty. Only two successes are \nneeded for a scene, but three will last f or a day, four indefinitely.\""

        "description": "This is a very unusual and potentially dangerous effect, since in tampers \nwith the basic matrix of the casters personality. In essence, over the \ncourse of several day-long ritual the mage subjects himself to increasing \namounts of physical and mental stress, in effort to literally fragment \nhis mind. This IS as dangerous and as hard as it sounds. The ritual, \nbeing a fairly new invention, varies little depending and always involves \nprolonged meditation, coupled with fasting. Physical injuries ranging \nfrom cracked ribs to broken limbs are also very common by the conclusion \nof the ritual. However, if the mage succeeds both in establishing the \nfracture, and controlling the emerging personalities this may be enough \nto qualify him for an Arete point (which still must be bought with \nexperience, folks), as his view of reality will never be the same.\nAt the conclusion of the successful ritual, the mage can accumulate a \ntotal of up to 5 new personalities. While some brave (or stupid) mages \nattempted to increase the number, the excess personalities usually \ndissolve within a matter of days. All of the personalities (called \nSecondaries, to distinguish them from the core, or Primary personality) \nare not complete in themselves, and should be regarded as limited \naspects. On the other hand, it is almost impossible to predict what \nSecondaries the mage will manifest by examining his core personality.  \nMost mages acquire some variation of the common types :Thinker, Poet, \nWarrior, Leader, Healer and Sneak. All of them, however, are instructed \nto create one Secondary called Guardian. The Guardian manages your body \nand psyche, acting to protect it from attacks, both mental and physical.  \nThe benefit of having Secondaries (besides always having somebody to talk \nto during breakfast) is their capability to focus absolutely on a task at \nhand. This effectively increases the performance by a large margin.\nGame Mechanics: The ritual, which occurs over the course of several \ndays is a very, very demanding affair. For obvious reason, it is very \nmuch desirable to have another Adept of Mind along, in case of failure \n(and especially botches). The mage must obtain at the very least 3 \nsuccesses on his Arete roll vs. difficulty of 9 (standard modifiers \napply) to avoid complications (STs are encouraged to be really nasty in \ncase of botches. Really.) Obviously, if less the 5 successes are \nobtained, the magick will need to be periodically maintained, which can \nbe rather hazardous to one\"s health. Upon successful completion, mage \ncan create the number of Secondaries equal to the number of his \nsuccesses. The Secondaries should be named, preferably w/ names \nevocative of their natures. As the last step, the Secondaries are \nassigned Skills that they possess. Note, that for a Secondary to posses \na skill (talent, knowledge) the mage must know it too. Each Secondary \ncan be assigned maximum of 3 skills, which must be related by function.  \nOther skills can be added later (still maximum total of 3, though).  \nHowever, the Primary personality must retain at least a third of all \nskills, talents and knowledges. The benefit of superior concentration \nresults in each skill possessed by a Secondary being increased by one \ndot. This \"shadow point\" has no bearing on experience, which is \ncalculated by normal means.\nThe Guardian Secondary is the one that manages your body, and protects \nyou from danger. The mage becomes harder to surprise (mundanely of \ncourse), since the Guardian always monitors the senses for unusual clues \nand signs. This works even if mage is sleeping (though not if he is \ndrugged or unconscious). The mage can also ignore 1 point of wound \npenalties (i.e. at Wounded the mage would be at -1, etc.), as the \nGuardian doesn\"t allow something as small as slash in your left side \nbother you.\nConclusion: This could potentially be a difficult thing to role-play \n(which should appeal to all ex-Malkavians out there). On the other \nhand, the thing to remember is that the Secondary is only an aspect of a \npersonality, and not a complete one, so most of the time it will be \ndominated by one or two emotions. For example, the Sneak would be \nparanoid and utterly without scruples most of the time."

The degree of fear \nshe produces is a matter of choice. A subtle impression of unease will \ndeter people without a genuine reason to go there. A much greater effect \nwill create one of those places that have a bad reputation - haunted \ncottages, dangerous alleys and the areas that you just don\"t go. A very \npowerful mage or a cabal can create a place that most sleepers cannot \neven approach, certainly not without a very good reason.\nThe trick is to gauge the right intensity.

Coincidences can often be used in graveyards, secluded glens and \nplaces of tragedy etcetera. Finally, this rote can be expanded to exclude \ncertain people, those who carry a special seal or any other signal that \nthe mage desires, although this will require additional spheres. \nNephandi also use a variation on this rote, although theirs produces a \nmore active sense of evil.\n\"Typically, in addition to successes needed for area affected (which \nvaries according to locale), two successes would be needed for a subtle \naura, five successes for a very real sensation of fear and ten or more \nto drive away determined trespassers.\""

The mathemagicians have\nfound that by judiciously exploiting known holes in accepted\ntheories, technomancers can use magickal effects normally\nnot allowed while still not contradicting the theory (and\nincurring paradox). To find these \"G|del Openings\" extensive\ncomputer simulations and tweaking of the model is needed,\nwhich usually requires the help of the sharpest minds of the\nMRG. In exchange, it is possible to find situations or\nmethods which make certain operations permissible even if\nthey are not part of the paradigm. This makes it possible to\ndo some work normally done in Horizon realms on Earth\ninstead, which is much more economical.\nThe desired effect must not be directly vulgar (against the\nlaws of consensus reality), but doesn\"t have to be\ncoincidental. A typical example would be the use of\nnanotechnology; its currently not in the paradigm, and its\ncapabilities are as yet undefined. By modelling the paradigm\nand modifying the effect slightly, the mathemagicians can\nfind circumstances where the nanotechnology would work even\nif its not part of the paradigm. A necessary part of this is\nto make sure the effect will not leave unambiguous traces if\nthe paradigm should change so that the effect was never\npossible. In the example, the nanotechnology have to be\npossible to explain away as biotechnology or something\nsimilar if it later turns out that the symposium decides it\nshould be scrapped.\n[ If the rote succeeds, a set of related vulgar without - witnesses \neffects can be made coincidental. ]"

In the 19th century, the Order started publicly using\nmany Mind effects using its Showstone focus. Though some of\nthese early mesmerists were hunted by the Technocracy or\nsuccumbed to Paradox, the idea of Hypnosis was firmly planted in\nthe minds of the sleepers. In the years since, the Technocracy\nhas had no choice but to \"explain\" the phenomenon, though doing\nso has not stopped the Order from making use of it.\nHypnosis places the subject, who must be willing or\nunsuspecting if the magick is to be Static, in a suggestible\nmental state. Hypnotized subjects can be probed for information,\ngiven post-hypnotic suggestion to implant compulsions that will\nbe acted on later, or helped in a variety of ways.\n[Hypnotizing a cooperative or unsuspecting subject requires\nonly one success, but unsuspecting subjects make a Willpower roll\nto resist. Unwilling subjects can be Hypnotized by coincidental\nmagick requiring 2 successes. The state of mind brought about by\nHypnosis allows for all the standard \"tricks\" including implanted\nsuggestions. Subjects get a second Willpower roll to resist any\nimplanted suggestions they are disinclined to perform.\nIn addition, Hypnosis can be used to help a subject achieve\nsome of the benefits of the first sphere of mind. Memories can\nbe recovered, pain blocked, and autonomic responses controlled. \nHalf the successes obtained in Hypnotising a subject can be\napplied to giving that subject such abilities.]\nF/X - The effect of this Rote is so commonly accepted among sleepers\nthat it can be considered Static magick."

If it doesn\"t find that code then it begins to reproduce at a phenomenal rate. It will split into 2 virals every 15 seconds achieving a groth rate equal to (Number of initial virals)*(2^n) where n equals the number of 15 second intervals. The virus is designed to be extremely resistant and to survive even in a werewolf\"s immune\nsystem. The virus continues to reproduce until it either encounters the \ncorrect code again or it reaches the saturation level for the host. \nSaturation will usually occur within 10 minutes even assuming that only 1\nvirus survives in the initial infection. Assume that 10 virals per success \nhave infected the victim who will receive a stamina roll(difficulty 10 for\nnormals, difficulty 8 for supernaturals). Each success indicates that 10 \nvirals were destroyed by the victim\"s immune system.

Many of the holy stones were regarded as the centre of creation by the local believers, and in a way they were all tied together (it was not uncommon for such stones to be engraved in a net-like pattern). By praying aloud and beating their fists against the stone in rhythm with the prayer, they could make their prayers faintly heard in all other temples of the Mother. This was especially prominent in the sacred caves or wells, in which could sometimes be heard whispering prayers from other places."

It is derived from the fact that most NWO operatives pose\nas official agents of some wordly power (i.e as government agents or Police\nOfficers.) It is thus easy for them to set up this rote as a coincidence. The\neffect involves causing a moving vehicle to slow down and stop. This is\nachieved by two methods. The first is the manipulation of the driver\"s mind -\ncausing him/her to believe that it would be a good idea to stop. The second,\nwhich is sometimes included as a precaution against the first method not\nworking, involves manipulating kinetic forces so that the car can no longer\nmove. A coincidental effect is easily maintained if the NWO mage is acting as a\npolice officer as passers-by (and the \"paradox police\") simpily see an obvious\nlaw-breaker being pulled over by the police. It is very easy for a good NWO\noperative to dream up a charge to bring against an enemy of the pogrom."

Firstly the mages gather together in an \narea dominated by dead spirits, such as a very large graveyard, a  \nbattle-field or the site of some terrible disaster. (the most recent \nsite was a large field in China where hundreds of prisoners are \nregularly executed). The mages then begin to draw up the forgotten \nspirits of the dead. These pitiful, barely conscious things are gathered \nby the mages who slowly begin to weave them together. Slowly, over the \ncourse of the night, a patchwork monster of lost souls takes form. It is \nthe essence of death and can produce only death. Using whatever magick \nthey can to control it, the mages send it out to kill their enemies. In \nthe past it has been sent after some powerful enemy or let loose to \ndestroy whole villages or towns. It is important to understand that the \nReaper is a near unstoppable force for death. It has, in historical \ntimes, decimated entire chantries. Physical barriers cannot stop it and \nonly the most powerful or ancient of wards can keep it at bay. Nothing \ncan fly faster than it. The strength of the Reaper depends upon the skill \nof the mages who created it and on where they performed the rote. Its \nstrength is invariably vast however. The Reaper is a monstrosity and the \nspirits of which it is composed gradually fall away. Yet beyond a \ncertain point, the Reaper begins to feed upon the spirits of those it \nmurders, binding them into its own being. At this \"critical mass\" point \nit is best to simply give up attempts at restraining the monster and \nhead for the nearest horizon realm.\n\"Many successes are required to create a Reaper. More successes create a \nstronger Reaper (provided the spirits are available), but too few \nsuccesses simply cause the entity to fall apart into hundreds of \nseparate spirits.\""

The longer a spirit has been dead, \nthe more difficult they are to call. Some ghosts become very powerful \nafter death, and are correspondingly more difficult to summon.\nThe rote does not compel the ghost to cooperate, nor does it give the \nshade any more intelligence than they possessed in life. In fact, long \ndead spirits are often confused or even insane, and it can be difficult \nto get useful information out of them. Most spirits have little in the \nway of power to effect the living world, but a few (known as wraiths) \nhave greater strength. Wraiths make useful servants, but are dangerous \nto deal with, having talents that could strike back at the mage.\nThe spirit of almost any dead individual can be summoned by this Rote, \nseemingly contradicting reincarnation theories or the existence of some \nsort of benevolent afterlife, views common to the Euthanatos and \nCelestial Chorus, respectively. Both of these traditions claim that most \n(if not all) of the shades summoned by this ritual are not actually the \nspirit of the departed person, but are some sort of Umbral reflection \nleft by their passing, which can linger for a long period of time.

Other \nstrange and confusing things can happen as well, such as receiving the \nanswer too late to be of use, or before the Cultist even asked the question.\nOnce a Cultist has used this rote at least once, she is linked into the \nNetwork. Every month or so thereafter, the Cultist will receive queries \nfrom other Cultists elsewhere in space and time, on any number of \nsubjects. There is nothing compelling the Cultist to answer, but it is \nconsidered gauche not to do so if the Cultist knows something about the \nsubject.

Although many young Akashics are quite capable of performing this rote, to do so effectively requires a master. The focus for this rote is a set of twelve highly sharpened iron shuriken. By focusing his Ki energy through his mind and into the shuriken, he generates enough magnetic force to send them hurtling through the air at incredible velocity. With concentration the Akashic brother can direct them wherever he wishes, causing them to glide and swoop like a flock of agile birds... very sharp birds. The razor edged shuriken are quite capable of slicing through muscle tissue, vital organs and (with the power of a master behind them) of shattering bone. The shuriken need not stay together but can divide and regroup to strike many different targets. A master is quite capable of the concentration needed to direct several groups of shuriken at blinding speed. A variation on this includes a Correspondence co-location effect that makes the shuriken all but omnipresent (this also requires Mind 1 to direct them in such circumstances). When the Akashic ceases concentration then the shuriken simply hover until he brings them to mind once more. It is possible to use less than the full twelve shuriken but that is the traditional number and\nthe standard that Akashic Brothers are expected to reach."

The Whirlwind Kata has the same effect as \"Accelerate Time\" (Mage p.218), giving the user an extra action for each success over two. However, it can only affect the caster and any allies who have been students for many years. The actual operation of the rote is also slightly different: The caster is sped up, but to opponents and observers he seems to be moving at a normal, even unhurried, speed. Thus, casual attacks catch targets off guard, languid dodges evade several opponents, and the fastest strikes are smoothly blocked.

        "description": "Euthanatos of Africa have been raising corpses as long as anyone can remember and today, those who follow this tradition still use the technique as a wonderful source of servants. However, there now seem to be as many rotes for doing this as there are mages. This particular rote is believed to be the one used by the reknowned Baron Samedi. Several voodoo priests are fond of it and even sleepers have learnt the basic ritual. The word Zombie does not actually mean an animated corpse in this case however. It is still essentially a living human being. The first stage of this rote is to find a suitable subject and induce a \nstate of suspended animation in him. This may be done by magick but more usually a herbal poison is used. The body is traditionally buried and left for a while before being retrieved, but there is no actual need for \nthis. The poison brings the victim to the point of death (without \ncausing tissue damage) which weakens the link between the body and the \nspirit. Most of the rituals of the voodoo priest are solely for the \npurpose of breaking this link. If too little poison was administered \nthen the link will be too strong to be broken. Conversely, if too much \nwas used then the body quickly dies and is useless. Just as the link is \nat its weakest (that is when the subject is about to die) the mage \nquickly drives out the spirit if he can and then hurriedly neutralizes \nthe poison and drags the body back to life. This is no easy task and \nmentors usually make disciples practice on animals before progressing to \npeople. If successful then the mage has a living, intelligent body with \nno soul - and thus no will of its own - a Zombie. There are a number of \nproblems facing the young voodoo priest however. If he works too slowly \nthen the body begins to deteriorate before he can drag it back to life. \nWithout oxygen the brain rapidly suffers damage. that is why so many \nZombies are slow and a little dense. The second problem is that although \nthe Zombie has no will of its own it has no particular loyalty. If \nanything it just tends to obey the person that can shout the loudest. \nThus the Zombie needs to be trained. This frequently but does not have \nto involve Mind magick. Finally, a spiritless body is a walking  \ninvitation to any passing Umbrood who fancies playing about in the \"real\" \nworld. It is like leaving a Ferrari around with the keys in the ignition. \nTo prevent this the mage seals the Zombie against the Umbra. If all this \nis done then the mage has an excellent servant / body-guard / \ndinner-date or whatever.\n\"This is an extended ritual. Firstly the victim must be rendered deeply \ncomatose (Life 4 or poison). Some experience is needed to judge this \ncorrectly. Secondly the spirit must be driven out (Spirit 4). At least \n10 successes are needed; possibly more for those with strong Avatars. \nFinally the body must be healed (Life 3). 4 successes are needed and \nmust be achieved within one turn.\""
